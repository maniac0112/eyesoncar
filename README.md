We want to build an interaction system between the pedestrians and autonomous vehicles.
Imagine youâ€™re a pedestrian trying to cross a road. You see a car rushing towards you while the driver is busy using his cell phone.
As we enter the era of self-driving cars, this sight would not uncommon.

We plan to replace the interaction that routinely happens between the pedestrian and the driver by interaction between the pedestrians
and the car itself. We do this by installing eyes on the car that seek eye contact with pedestrians on the road. This will also give confidence
to pedestrians that the autonomous vehicle is aware of them!

Making this repository to keep a record of my progress for this project so far, in an organized way!

Adios!
